## Description

Planet Age Calculator is a web app that helps users determine their age on other planets. A solar year on Earth lasts 365 days, but on other planets, the length of a year will vary. As a result, a person's age will also vary if a different planet, with solar years that are shorter or longer, is used to calculate their age. In this web app, a user can input their age and choose a planet, and the program will use objects and methods to return their new age on the specified planet.
